AI-powered wildfire detection and explainability project using satellite imagery and deep learning (TechLabs Munich 2025)

# 🔥 FireWatch AI – Satellite-Based Wildfire Detection and Forecasting

🚀 An AI-powered wildfire detection and forecasting system using satellite imagery, weather data, and explainable deep learning. Built for TechLabs Munich 2025 and aligned with my master's thesis on environmental AI solutions.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Wildfires are a growing global threat due to climate change. This project builds a deep learning pipeline that:
- Detects active fires from satellite images
- Forecasts wildfire risk based on weather and vegetation
- Provides explainable AI insights using SHAP and Grad-CAM
- Visualizes results on an interactive Streamlit dashboard

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

Traditional fire detection systems are too slow, lack precision, and don’t scale with rising risk. FireWatch AI aims to provide faster, smarter, and explainable early warnings using open data and deep learning.
